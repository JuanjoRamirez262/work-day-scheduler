# work-day-scheduler

This code was made by [Juan Jose Ramirez](https://github.com/JuanjoRamirez262). You can access the live application through the following [link](https://juanjoramirez262.github.io/work-day-scheduler/).

## Description

The idea of this code is to create a work scheduler that let us save task, notes or reminders for the day, dividing it by hours. It allows to customize the hours office hours (read first variables of `script.js`) save the notes of each our independly from the others hours, and the data its saved locally, so you can re-open the scheduler in the same day and the informations will be there.

## Author notes

I tryed to create this code using Javascript as much as I can, instead of using HTML.
